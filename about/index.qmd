I am a PhD candidate in Finance at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on TechFin, FinTech, and RegTech. Broadly speaking, I am interested in questions such as:

- How can financial systems more effectively support technological innovation?
- How does technological innovation reshape financial services and market structure?
- Do technological advances (such as the use of AI) create new risks, and how should financial regulation respond?
